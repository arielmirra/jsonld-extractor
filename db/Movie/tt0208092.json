    "reviewBody":"This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. 10/10.\n\nI was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.\n\nI must pick out specific actors who were just over the top - meaning 10+!\n\nJason Statham as \"Turkish\" is simply superb - a star of very high caliber. (You should see him in anything he made, and read my comment about John Carpenter's movie: \"Ghosts of Mars.\")\n\nAlan Ford as \"Brick Top\" is terrifying - his forced speaking style made me think that he was chewing on the flesh of his previous victim.\n\nVinnie Jones as \"Bullet Tooth Tony\" is total tough head to foot tough - a walking brick wall - a marine for all seasons - none tougher.\n\nBrad Pitt as \"Mickey O'Neil\" is utterly 110% convincing. I never liked Mr. Pitt's work before this - but this one totally sold me - he is as solid an actor as ever came out of Hollywood... and better!\n\nFinally, Guy Ritchie should be recognized as a Michelangelo of film.\n\n-LD",
