    "reviewBody":"''Life, uh... finds a way.''\n\nOne of the best & most iconic movie quotes of all times.\n\nI don't know what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. Really...\n\nConsidering this movie was made in 1993, visual effects are of incredible quality, as you see it better on blu-ray. When it comes to story, it's completely original, nearly flawless. I can't say too much about the acting. I believe acting is not the movie's strongest point. But still, it was enough for that movie. You don't need to be like Marlon Brando in a sci-fi movie about dinosaurs and has great visual & sound effects. The movie is very fun to watch.\n\nI also sensed a small message like, ''don't mess with nature''.\n\nBest thing about the movie (for me) was the score. Especially the ''Welcome to Jurassic Park'' scene. Of course we're talking about John Williams, the guy who wrote the theme for Star Wars, so that's not a surprise.\n\nHighly recommend it.\n\n9/10",
