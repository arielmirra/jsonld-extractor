There was something brilliant about seeing our \"hero\" at face value just like every other character along the way. There was no Batman/Bryce Wayne, there was only V and because of that it made him more of a myth and much more intriguing for what he stood for.\n\nVengence is in the title, but it so much more than that with a deeper meaning that rivals some of the best in Hollywood. I found myself reading more into the \"idea\" V represented. Now one of my favorite Comic Book Films.",
