    "reviewBody":"\"Seven-six-two millimeter. Full metal jacket.\" -Pvt. Leonard 'Pyle' Lawrence\n\nFull Metal Jacket is a great movie. Not the best from Kubrick, but works great as a war film. The plot is about a group of soldiers who are turned into killers in marine training, and are then sent off to the Vietnam War.\n\nKubrick once again does a great job at directing. Modine, D'Onofrio, Baldwin, and Howard give worthy performances, while Ermey gives an Oscar worthy (not even nominated) performance and steals the show. This is a very realistic look at Vietnam, while the battle scenes and script just aren't as satisfying as they are in the second half. Still, it is a wonderful film.\n\n9/10."
