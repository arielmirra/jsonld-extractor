    "reviewBody":"The best way to describe this movie in one word is; fun! \"Monsters, Inc.\" is a movie you can easily fall in love with. It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. \"Monsters, Inc.\" is entertainment at its bests.\n\nThe voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.\n\nThe story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.\n\nThere is some great dialog but the true power of \"Monsters, Inc.\" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!\n\nPure entertainment for the entire family!\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
