    "reviewBody":"Les Diaboliques is one of the tightest, pure suspense movies I have ever seen.  The story starts out slowly, but as it moves on, peculiar things start to happen.    This movie keeps you guessing in such a way, you are riveted to your seat, hoping for a quick resolution to the suspense.  Yet, as the story unfolds, the suspense deepens.  The final scene of the movie had me sitting back holding my breath.\n\nThis movie does not offer cheap, pop out and scare you tactics. Rather, it makes the viewer expect things to happen that don't.  You wait on the edge of your seat for the quick jump out and scare you event to take place, but instead, it sneaks up from behind you.  What an effect!\n\nLes Diaboliques is a classic film that delivers the complete suspense package.  It's not surprising that many suspense movies of the modern era have tried to copy the plot.  This movie is well worth renting in a video store, if you can find it.",
