    "reviewBody":"\"Im just a bum sitting in a motor home on a film set, Brando said, and they come looking for ZEUS\". \n\nI think Brando was a guy who was perfect in the moment. All his power and shortcomings can be revealed in a single sentence. Other's might have been great and still more will be. But there's just something about him. \n\nFor me, Brando has always been the ultimate male. Simply put, bruiting desire. Brando represents the very definition of method acting, even though he was said to have hated the phrase. Being able to reach inside yourself and pull something out that kicks everyone in the ass. He was truly one of a kind. They say sometimes beautiful people are born under a dark cloud. I think Brando was born under a rain of thunderbolts. He was powerful and tragic.\n\nOn The Waterfront is basically a showcase for Brando. Everything coming together. This film is truly one for the ages. \n\nI guess the only thing really wrong with this life is time.",
